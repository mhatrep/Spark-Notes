Areas to optimize Hive utilization:

1. Data Layout (Partitions and Buckets)
2. Data Sampling (Bucket and Block sampling)
3. Data Processing (Bucket Map Join and Parallel execution)


Lock: Lock the hive tables from unintentional deletes. This can be achieved by enabling no_drop on hive tables.
ALTER TABLE TableName enable no_drop;
ALTER TABLE TableName disable no_drop;
*Enabling this feature on production tables is a good practice

Batch Processing Systems express jobs in terms of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks (or stages). 
Each task is partitioned (based on the input data) for parallel processing and includes producer stages and consumer stages which rely on the output of the producer stages. 
The producer stages are executed on producer nodes and the consumer stages are executed on consumer nodes. 
Intermediary data flows through these tasks in many forms, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and/or, many-to-many. 
Many group based operations (such as aggregation, join, sort, etc.) usually require many-to-many data exchanges referred to as “data shuffle.”
----------------------------------------------
This data shuffle operation is paramount to the overall batch system's performance, fault tolerance, and scalability characteristics.
